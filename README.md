# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

1. map all recorded earthquakes in the past seven days. add some features to the map to showcase the severity of earthquakes for viewers
2. add tectonic plate data and major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(). 
3. add color and set the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using geoJSON().
4. add a third map style as a tile layer object.


## Result

This dynamic webpage can be explored by doing following steps:
 - Add street map and satellite map as base layer option
    
 - Map all earthquakes with Point geoJSON data as an overlay map. 
   Circle marker colors and radius were styled to appeal viewers based on the magtitude of earthquakes. Popups were also added to show their magnitude and location.

*An example multi-filter and its result:*
```
Enter Date : 1/1/2010
Enter a City: ----
Enter a State: ----
Enter a Country: us
Enter a Shape: sphere
```


## Summary
Overall, the webpage looks nice. The contents are coherent. Multi-filter works functionally. The theme and background image match the UFOs content very well. Still, the webpage can be improved a little bit. 
  1. A drawback of this webpage
     
     The data source is limited. The observation record of UFOs only covers the date from 1/1/2020 through 1/13/2020. This is unsufficient for this webpage. More data need to be collected. If it is impossible to get more date, there should be a remark beside `Enter Date` filter to clarify the date period.
  
  2. Two additional recommendations for further development 
     
     1. The text `Filter Search` is very frustrating for the users. It looks like a filter button, quite misleading. At the same time,  `UFO Sightings` button which is for unfiltering is on the very top left corner. Users might not notice it. For further improvement, I would suggest to create two buttons: `Filter Search` and `Go Back` below multi-filters. `Filter Search` button will triger the filter to show the filter results after user input the filters and click the `Filter Search` button. Whereas `Go Back` will take over the function of `UFO Sightings` button. It will guide user to go back to unfiltered table.
     2. The filter input must be exact macth to the format of data value in database. Currently, the input of city, state, country must be lowercase. Even though there are examples for each filter, these are not popular format for common use. If we can add a couple of codes to igonre or convert all input uppercase letter to lowercase letter, it will provide users a better experience on searching.
